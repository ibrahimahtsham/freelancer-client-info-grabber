Immediate:-

    be able to fetch to the minute
    clean up codebase
    get data for our own user, what are our hidden stats

    checkout some weird logic that is being applied in data table
    reporganize columns in the data table that makes sense

Stats that need to be shown:-

    heatmap of which days had more responses on a calendar, which days had awarded
    which locations had most awarded
    somehow show what shift had most bids made, heatmap form is nice
    stats for bid timings, which hours the bids were made the most, a distribution






Do later:-

    fix ui for add new employee screen
    fix rate limited not showing time remaining, see if there is any lirary that will let me read api headers
    auto select past whole month as range to 
    salary needs to take in acount the date of payment + if someone helped with chat
    auto scrollability in API Usage Statistics
    data table should have popups for each cell since some data can just go in overflow





QOL:

    optimize tabs switching
    dataset name functionality fix
    update progress bar with stages, record time for each stage
    integrate bid timings calculations too
    make it so datasets instantly are acessible without refreshing page after saving, also they should have proper names rn the dates are not accurately represented of the filter that was applied to get the dataset
    make it so after putting api token it welcomes you as your username and shows it on the navbar
    current data in dataset be updated in real time
