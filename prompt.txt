the data set is being saved but can it be made in a way that as soon it is saved i can access it through quick access and stored datasets dropdown, because right now untill i dont refresh the page they dont appear on there, also the name of the dataset is not being used in the dropdown or the quick access bar

can you provide me with the modifications that need to be made in order to implement this

can you do in a way where it wont include any unused variables
